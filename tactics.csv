Define the Problem,1,Talk to Real People,"Get out of your office to observe and listen to prospective, current, and former users--ideally in their natural environments. Ground your ideas for change in their real-life experiences."
Define the Problem,2,Be Your Own Customer,"Experience your organization's product or service the way customers or constituents do. You'll uncover customer service gaps, confusing instructions, and opportunities for new products, services, or features."
Define the Problem,3,Look Between the Silos,"The Achilles' heel of an organization is the space between the silos--i.e., between business units, academic departments, or government agencies--where broken handoffs or miscommunications can lead to poor customer experiences or wasteful repetition. Few people are paying attention or defending the status quo in these gray areas, making them ripe for quicker and more well-received changes."
Define the Problem,4,Play the Newbie Card,"Use your newness in an organization or a role to your advantage. Don't be afraid to ask questions about how things work in your institution, which can uncover significant opportunities that your longer-tenured colleagues can't see."
Define the Problem,5,Remember Employee Needs,Spend time in the field shadowing frontline employees to gather insights about what's really working--and what isn't. Prioritize improving internal processes just as you would end use improvements; use those internal improvements to gain buy-in for other changes you need employees to make that benefit external users.
Define the Problem,6,Beware of Red Teams and Problem Lists,"Avoid the temptation to make and share a laundry list of problems. You might gain some short-term attention for your insights, but you'll alienate too many people in the process. Worse, if you incorrectly characterize a problem, you might find yourself on the hook for having to solve it. Instead, focus your efforts on creating and testing solutions to problems."
Learn Your Org,1,Figure Out the Real Org Chart,"Relationships, knowledge, and power aren't captured by traditional org charts. Making your own map of who knows what, who controls what resources, and who is in cahoots with whom can help you strategically map out who to include, in what order, on your schemes."
Learn Your Org,2,Understand Incentives and Risks,"Everyone in your organization operates within a framework of incentives and risks. If you want a coworker to do something differently, you need to undesrtand what's stopping them from making that change today. Where possible, change their incentives to make doing what you want them to do the lowest-risk, highest-reward path."
Learn Your Org,3,Know the Consequences,"Know the consequences for breaking rules or not following existing processes. On one extreme is breaking the law and facing fines or imprisonment; on the other hand, if the worst that can happen is that you don't meet a performance goal next quarter, it might be a risk you're willing and able to take."
Learn Your Org,4,Understand Why,"Getting to the root reason behind a particular practice is often the key to changing it. It's possible the original rule, policy, or law gives you much more flexibility than people think--and sometimes the original reason may not even apply anymore! Asking why repeatedly and tying current practices "
Learn Your Org,5,Try the Normal Way First,"Before declaring that a process is broken and looking for ways around it, try it first. Your firsthand experience will help you gather real data about why adn where the process isn't working. Armed with the nuances of what a truly effective new process could look like, you'll have more credibility to convince others that you can design a new way of doing things."
Learn Your Org,6,Relax Fixed Constraints,"In a bureaucracy, it's easy to see the status quo as unmovable, akin to the laws of physics, rather than just the result of human inaction. Question assumptions about which constraints really are fixed, and see if you can develop a sense of shared agency with others."
Learn Your Org,7,Beware the Obvious Answer,"When it comes to long-standing problems in large organizations, solutions can appear obvious, especially to outsiders or newcomers. But it's rarely that simple."
Pitch the Solution,1,Write a One-Pager,Talk is cheap. Write down your idea on a single page to clarify your thinking and message.
Pitch the Solution,2,Think of the End at the Beginning,Be specific about what the future you envision looks like by doing thngs like writing the launch press release or mocking up potential media coverage. Use this future state vision to drive your day-to-day planning.
Pitch the Solution,3,Set Your North Star,"A compelling vision of the future that is both inspiring and broadly accessible makes it easier to get others across your organization to join forces with you. That vision, when written down and widely shared, can inspire and drive change in your bureaucracy."
Pitch the Solution,4,Use the Power of Visual Design,"Make your ideas stand out with written proposals printed on heavy stock, professional-looking presentations, and visually compelling prototypes. Even the most formal of reports can benefit from professional design elements."
Pitch the Solution,5,Consult a Thesaurus,"In your organization, specific words have connotations based on years of history. Choose your words carefully to find the ones that maximize what you're trying to accomplish while minimizing baggage."
Pitch the Solution,6,Show the Hard Numbers,Showing real numbers that contrast with teh way most people in a bureaucracy currently perceive reality--especially data that they have not seen before--can be a powerful catalyst for change.
Pitch the Solution,7,Tailor Your Pitch,"Align your idea with your organization's strategy, goals, and priorities. Reframe your messages in the context of what your audiences and organization care about most."
Pitch the Solution,8,Do the Work Outside the Meeting,"Do the hard work before and after a meeting to make sure that nothing unscripted or spontaneous happens. This work includes sharing materials ahead of time, having one-on-one conversations with key participants, and prepping allies with helpful talking points and questions to ask."
Pitch the Solution,9,"Sell, Baby, Sell","Gaining buy-in and resources for your idea is ultimately a sales job. Recognizing this, and learning the fine art of enterprise sales, can help your bureaucracy hacking gain traction."
Start Small and Build Momentum,1,Find Your Paperclip,"No matter where you sit in a bureaucracy, it can feel like you don't have enough resources under your control to accomplish your goals. You might be surprised at what you can accomplish when you trade with others for what you need."
Start Small and Build Momentum,2,"Act ""As If""","Bring your idea to life by acting as if it's already reality, even if it's not quite there yet."
Start Small and Build Momentum,3,Delivery Is the Strategy,"Plans and pitches can be effective bureaucracy-hacking tactics--but if you really want to drive progress toward your goals, start delivering on those plans. Even a seemingly small project, like improving a tracking spreadsheet for an internal team, can put you years ahead of where you'd be if you spend all your energy describing what you're going to do one day."
Start Small and Build Momentum,4,Go Second,"The more established the bureaucracy, the less likely it wants to be the first one to try a new process or adopt a new technique. Going first is often seen as risky and prone to errors or failure. Find or create precedents to make it seem like your organization is going second to create powerful peer pressure while mitigating risk."
Start Small and Build Momentum,5,Give Real Demos,"Once a decision maker interacts with a real working demo or prototype, you've changed the bar for the game--subsequent presentations with smoke and mirrors won't cut it. When you provide real, interactive demonstrations of your future vision, you make it htat much harder for your competitors to win out."
Start Small and Build Momentum,6,Pilot Is the Password,"Show a prototype of your idea and get feedback from the actual customers or the people impacted, in order to convince your organization to explore it further."
Start Small and Build Momentum,7,Define Metrics Up Front,"Get skeptics to agree to indicators of success ahead of time for your experiments, pilots, and proofs of concept. Also agree up front to failure criteria to make others comfortable with giving you a chance to try. Whenever possible, transparently show everyone how you are performing against those metrics."
Start Small and Build Momentum,8,Sweat the Small Stuff,"Detractors will get you in teh details. Get as much feedback as you can, as early as you can, about what specifics you need to consider. Even seemingly insignificant things, like having the corporate legal notice in a page footer of a website or white paper, can help stakeholders feel seen and heard, and tehrefore more willing to show their support."
Start Small and Build Momentum,9,Make the Bureaucracy Work for You,Most organizations have more existing resources and flexibility than you might think--learn how to take advantage of them.
Start Small and Build Momentum,10,Strangle the Mainframe,"Attack an overwhelmingly large problem with smaller wins that let you tackle it in bite-sized, manageable pieces--foten without the bureaucracy even realizing it should mount a defense."
Build Your Team,1,Cultivate the Karass,"You can't go it alone. Find and grow your karass--your informal group of people who want to get stuff done together. Armed with an understanding of which ""guild"" you belong to, build bridges with those who share your vision--especially those who have attempted your idea before and failed."
Build Your Team,2,Give Credit Liberally,"Give credit to others--authentically, generously, and publicly. You'll generate goodwill and trust by recognizing their contributions. Welcome when others take credit for your initiative, because it means you'll have more champions and allies in the long term."
Build Your Team,3,Find the Doers,"Find the people who can actually do the work, and pair up with them."
Build Your Team,4,Make It Easy for the Other Person,Help other people help you by making it as easy as possible for them to do what you need.
Build Your Team,5,Don't be a Tourist,Find a way to help or get out of the way.
Build Your Team,6,Make Your Job,"Bureaucracies are mostly filled with people hired to satisfy a specific, and sometimes outdated, job description. With some creativity and entrepreneurial spirit, you can create a new role that better leverages your specific skills and passions."
Build Your Team,7,Create People Flow,"Add people to your project through fellowships, internships, in-residence programs, and other temporary, nontraditional, and part-time mechanisms. New talent, paired with experienced teams and mentors, can create breakthrough momentum for your project--and just might make an even larger impact over time."
Build Your Team,8,"Give People a Choice, and a Chance","You won't win everyone over to your way of thinking, but you may win over some by giving them an honest chance to join you. For example, if you are trying to convert to a new technology system, the current team needs a genuine opportunity to learn the new application and be part of the roll-out."
Build Your Team,9,Stab People in the Chest,"Be open and honest with your detractors about where and how you disagree. This builds a unique sort of trust, where, despite your difference of opinion, your colleagues will gain confidence that you won't blindside them down the line."
Make it Stick,1,Use the Bureaucracy Against Itself,"Use the routine practices of your organization--like committees, approvals, and reviews--to formalize your changes within the bureaucracy's current way of doing business."
Make it Stick,2,Pick Up the Pen,"Large organizations depend on written rules, processes, and plans. Find opportunities to help those who are writing down the rules. Where possible, volunteer to write the rules yourself for long-term influence."
Make it Stick,3,Use Leadership Changes to Your Advantage,"Changes in leadership bring new opportunities to gain a champion. Shape an incoming leader's agenda by talking with them directly and influencing what they learn early in their tenure. Even if they have a long history with your organization, once in a new role, a leader is less likely to see constraints as truly fixed and more likely to be open to bold ideas."
Make it Stick,4,Always Be Ready for Five Minutes with the Head Honcho,You never know when you are going to run into your big boss or another important stakeholder outside your chain of command. Having a few talking points prepared will serve you well in a chance encounter.
Make it Stick,5,Don't Waste a Crisis,"Bureaucracies are more receptive to change during times of crisis, especially if your idea is related to fixing or recovering from the problem at hand. Being prepared with a one-pager--or even a full plan that's ready to go--will best position you to take advantage of an unexpected opening."
Make it Stick,6,Leverage the Big Bosses,"Large organizations are hierarchical, with a lot of focus on what the big boss thinks, says, and does. Use this to your advantage and find ways to gain attention and air cover from your higher-ups."
Make it Stick,7,Work from the Outside In,"Leverage external stakeholders who can provide outside support for your initiative, or even own part of the solution."
Make it Stick,8,Get Public Committments,"Get your organizaiton to publicly commit to specific actions--and find ways to leverage that commitment to generate momentum for your initiative. If your organization also has the power to convene and celebrate other groups, ask others to make public commitments on shared goals that you can unveil and collaborate on together."
Make it Stick,9,Pay the Box Guy,Honor the promises you make to people--or they may be the one to take your entire project down.
Make it Stick,10,Pick Your Battles,"You need a clear understanding of what you can compromise on, and what you can't, to achieve your objectives. Consider the extent of the disagreement and the players involved to help figure out whether you should give in or fight back over a particular detail."
Make it Stick,11,Don't Try to Make the Bureaucracy Care,"Bureaucracies, unlike the people that inhabit them, don't have feelings. You cannot persuade your bureaucracy to change through emotional arguments. Instead, understand exactly the criteria that are going to be used to make a decision--and meet them."
Make it Stick,12,Play the Long Game,"Your bureaucracy isn't going anywhere, and no change is going to happen overnight. Expecting that your entire project or initiative will be adopted quickly and at scale is unrealistic. If you have your endgame in mind, you can make strategic chess moves that get you closer and closer to that goal, one bureaucracy hack at a time."
Make it Stick,13,Create a New Org,Consider whether your idea might flourish faster somewhere beyond your home bureaucracy.
Make it Stick,14,Stay Calm and Carry On,"It's not a matter of if something is going to go sideways, it's a matter of when. If you can stay calm when you hear unpleasant news, or when a crisis comes out of nowhere, you'll build credibility and trust among your colleagues. Bureaucracy hacking requires grit and patience."
Make it Stick,15,Leave Your Bureaucracy Better Off,"Consider how your changes will persever after you leave the organization, and what you can put in place now to make lasting change after you're gone."
